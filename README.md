# ChatENG
An AI-powered English language practice application

## Project Overview
ChatENG is designed to help non-native English speakers improve their language skills through personalized AI-driven interaction, combining conversational practice, automated testing, and speech capabilities in one app.
<br/>
This is a solo project. I designed and implemented the full stack — frontend, backend, AI integration, and speech functionality.

## Features

## FrontEnd
Built with React.js for a responsive and user-friendly experience.

## Server
Developed using Node.js and Express to handle server-side logic and API interactions.

## Database
Uses MongoDB for data storage and management.

## API
- Gemini Flash 2.0 – AI model for generating content and evaluating user input.
